# Movie DB

## Getting Started

The data is fetched from the [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). It takes a few seconds to load the data, so if you see no data, wait a few seconds and refresh the page.

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the application.
2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.
